# Quell: Haskell Fork

This is a survey programming language for me.

https://mizunashi-mana.github.io/quell/

## Road Map

1. Implement sub-language with polymorphic types and higher-order functions, modules by `Haskell`.
2. Implement runtime by `Rust`.
3. Implement full-language without macros by `Haskell`.
4. Bootstrapping compiler by `Quell`.
5. Implement standard libraries.
6. Implement macros.
